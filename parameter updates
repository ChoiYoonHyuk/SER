First, let us assume the parameters of source and target re-
gressor as P s
r , P t
r , respectively. The loss function associated
with the update of P d
r (d denotes domain) is a direct classifi-
cation error, Ld
pred. Here, we can define the loss for P s
r and
P t
r as follows:
Ls
r = Ls
pred = 1
Ns
∑
u,i∈Ds
(̂ ys,O
u,i − ys
u,i)2,
Lt
r = Lt
pred = 1
Nt
∑
u,i∈Dt
(̂yt,O
u,i − yt
u,i)2
Then, for each domain, we can derive the loss function for
the update of siamese encoder P d
e as below:
Ls
e = Ls
pred + βLs
encoder ,
Lt
e = Lt
pred + βLt
encoder
, where Ld
encoder = ||Ed
u,i − Id
u,i||2

The parameter of domain discriminator Pd is updated
with the average of domain-invariant Ls,com
d , Lt,com
d and
domain-specific Ls,spe
d , Lt,spe
d losses, which can be defined
as
